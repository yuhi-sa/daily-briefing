- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML
- **Published**: 2026-02-23 05:00 UTC
- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17676
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.17676v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large Language Models and AI agents across critical societal and technical domains is hindered by persistent behavioral pathologies including sycophancy, hallucination, and strategic deception that resist mitigation via reinforcement learning. Current safety paradigms treat these failures as transient training artifacts, lacking a unified theoretical framework to explain their emergence and stability. Here we show that th...

### 11. Reducing Text Bias in Synthetically Generated MCQAs for VLMs in Autonomous Driving
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML

- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17677
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.17677v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) benchmarks are an established standard for measuring Vision Language Model (VLM) performance in driving tasks. However, we observe the known phenomenon that synthetically generated MCQAs are highly susceptible to hidden textual cues that allow models to exploit linguistic patterns rather than visual context. Our results show that a VLM fine-tuned on such data can achieve accuracy comparable to human-vali...

- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17682
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.17682v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Consistency-based generative models like Shortcut and MeanFlow achieve impressive results via a target-aware design for solving the Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE). Typically, such methods introduce a target time $r$ alongside the current time $t$ to modulate outputs between a local multi-step derivative ($r = t$) and a global few-step integral ($r = 0$). However, the conventional "one input, one output" paradigm enforces a partition of the traini...
