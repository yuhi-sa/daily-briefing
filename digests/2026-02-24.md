### 12. Revisiting the Seasonal Trend Decomposition for Enhanced Time Series Forecasting
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML
- **Published**: 2026-02-24 05:00 UTC
- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18465
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.18465v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Time series forecasting presents significant challenges in real-world applications across various domains. Building upon the decomposition of the time series, we enhance the architecture of machine learning models for better multivariate time series forecasting. To achieve this, we focus on the trend and seasonal components individually and investigate solutions to predict them with less errors. Recognizing that reversible instance normalization...

### 13. Physiologically Informed Deep Learning: A Multi-Scale Framework for Next-Generation PBPK Modeling

- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.18472v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a cornerstone of model-informed drug development (MIDD), providing a mechanistic framework to predict drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Despite its utility, adoption is hindered by high computational costs for large-scale simulations, difficulty in parameter identification for complex biological systems, and uncertainty in interspecies extrapolation. In this ...

### 15. Support Vector Data Description for Radar Target Detection
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML

- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18486
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.18486v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Classical radar detection techniques rely on adaptive detectors that estimate the noise covariance matrix from target-free secondary data. While effective in Gaussian environments, these methods degrade in the presence of clutter, which is better modeled by heavy-tailed distributions such as the Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) and Compound-Gaussian (CGD) families. Robust covariance estimators like M-estimators or Tyler's estimator address t...

### 16. Learning to Remember: End-to-End Training of Memory Agents for Long-Context Reasoning
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML

- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.18493v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Long-context LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems process information passively, deferring state tracking, contradiction resolution, and evidence aggregation to query time, which becomes brittle under ultra long streams with frequent updates. We propose the Unified Memory Agent (UMA), an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that unifies memory operations and question answering within a single policy. UMA maintains a dual ...

### 17. On the Dynamics of Observation and Semantics
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML
- **Published**: 2026-02-24 05:00 UTC
- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18494
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.18494v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A dominant paradigm in visual intelligence treats semantics as a static property of latent representations, assuming that meaning can be discovered through geometric proximity in high dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and fin...

### 18. Weak-Form Evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Solving Partial Differential Equations
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML
- **Published**: 2026-02-24 05:00 UTC
- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18515
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.18515v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form a central component of scientific computing. Among recent advances in deep learning, evolutionary neural networks have been developed to successively capture the temporal dynamics of time-dependent PDEs via parameter evolution. The parameter updates are obtained by solving a linear system derived from the governing equation residuals at each time step. However, strong-form evolutionary approaches can yi...

### 19. Measuring the Prevalence of Policy Violating Content with ML Assisted Sampling and LLM Labeling
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML
- **Published**: 2026-02-24 05:00 UTC
- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18518
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.18518v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Content safety teams need metrics that reflect what users actually experience, not only what is reported. We study prevalence: the fraction of user views (impressions) that went to content violating a given policy on a given day. Accurate prevalence measurement is challenging because violations are often rare and human labeling is costly, making frequent, platform-representative studies slow. We present a design-based measurement system that (i)...

- **Link**: https://vercel.com/blog/security-boundaries-in-agentic-architectures
- **Summary**: Most agents today run generated code with full access to your secrets.As more agents adopt coding agent patterns, where they read filesystems, run shell commands, and generate code, they're becoming multi-component systems that each need a different level of trust.While most teams run all of these components in a single security context, because that's how the default tooling works, we recommend thinking about these security boundaries differently.Below we walk through:The actors in agentic s...

- **Link**: https://vercel.com/changelog/safely-inject-credentials-in-http-headers-with-vercel-sandbox
- **Summary**: Vercel Sandbox can now automatically inject HTTP headers into outbound requests from sandboxed code. This keeps API keys and tokens safely outside the sandbox VM boundary, so apps running inside the sandbox can call authenticated services without ever accessing the credentials. Header injection is configured as part of the network policy using transform. When the sandbox makes an HTTPS request to a matching domain, the firewall adds or replaces the specified headers before forwarding the requ...
