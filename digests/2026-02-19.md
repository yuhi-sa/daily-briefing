- **Summary**: AI-enabled deception now permeates our online lives. There are the high-profile cases you may easily spot, like when White House officials recently shared a manipulated image of a protester in Minnesota and then mocked those asking about it. Other times, it slips quietly into social media feeds and racks up views, like the videos that…

- **Summary**: More money has been invested in AI than it took to land on the moon. Spending on the technology this year is projected to reach up to $700 billion, almost double last year’s spending. Part of the impetus for this frantic outlay is a conviction among investors and policymakers in the United States that it needs to “beat China.” Indeed, headlines have long cast AI development as a zero-sum rivalry between the U.S. and China, framing the technology’s advance as an arms race with a defined finish...

To address this gap, we introduce the Meme Reply Selection task and present MaMe-Re (Manga Meme Reply Benchmark), ...

### 27. Kalman-Inspired Runtime Stability and Recovery in Hybrid Reasoning Systems

- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.15855v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Hybrid reasoning systems that combine learned components with model-based inference are increasingly deployed in tool-augmented decision loops, yet their runtime behavior under partial observability and sustained evidence mismatch remains poorly understood. In practice, failures often arise as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than as isolated prediction errors. This work studies runtime stability in hybrid reasoning syste...

### 28. Genetic Generalized Additive Models

- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.15877v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) balance predictive accuracy and interpretability, but manually configuring their structure is challenging. We propose using the multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II to automatically optimize GAMs, jointly minimizing prediction error (RMSE) and a Complexity Penalty that captures sparsity, smoothness, and uncertainty. Experiments on the California Housing dataset show that NSGA-II discovers GAMs that outperf...

### 29. IT-OSE: Exploring Optimal Sample Size for Industrial Data Augmentation
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML

- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15878
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.15878v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In industrial scenarios, data augmentation is an effective approach to improve model performance. However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample...

### 30. BamaER: A Behavior-Aware Memory-Augmented Model for Exercise Recommendation
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML

- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15879
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.15879v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Exercise recommendation focuses on personalized exercise selection conditioned on students' learning history, personal interests, and other individualized characteristics. Despite notable progress, most existing methods represent student learning solely as exercise sequences, overlooking rich behavioral interaction information. This limited representation often leads to biased and unreliable estimates of learning progress. Moreover, fixed-length...

### 31. Distributed physics-informed neural networks via domain decomposition for fast flow reconstruction
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML

- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.15883v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a powerful paradigm for flow reconstruction, seamlessly integrating sparse velocity measurements with the governing Navier-Stokes equations to recover complete velocity and latent pressure fields. However, scaling such models to large spatiotemporal domains is hindered by computational bottlenecks and optimization instabilities. In this work, we propose a robust distributed PINNs framework designed ...

### 32. Adaptive Semi-Supervised Training of P300 ERP-BCI Speller System with Minimum Calibration Effort
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML

- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15955
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.15955v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A P300 ERP-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) speller is an assistive communication tool. It searches for the P300 event-related potential (ERP) elicited by target stimuli, distinguishing it from the neural responses to non-target stimuli embedded in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Conventional methods require a lengthy calibration procedure to construct the binary classifier, which reduced overall efficiency. Thus, we proposed a unified f...
