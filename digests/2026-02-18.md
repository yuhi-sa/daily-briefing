This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each...

### 19. PolyNODE: Variable-dimension Neural ODEs on M-polyfolds
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML

- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15128
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.15128v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) are geometric deep learning models based on dynamical systems and flows generated by vector fields on manifolds. Despite numerous successful applications, particularly within the flow matching paradigm, all existing NODE models are fundamentally constrained to fixed-dimensional dynamics by the intrinsic nature of the manifold's dimension. In this paper, we extend NODEs to M-polyfolds (spaces that ca...

### 20. Protecting Language Models Against Unauthorized Distillation through Trace Rewriting
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML

- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15143
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.15143v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a widely adopted technique for transferring capabilities from LLMs to smaller, more efficient student models. However, unauthorized use of knowledge distillation takes unfair advantage of the considerable effort and cost put into developing frontier models. We investigate methods for modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces to achieve two objectives that deter unauthorized distillation: (1) \emph{anti-distillation},...

### 21. Refine Now, Query Fast: A Decoupled Refinement Paradigm for Implicit Neural Fields
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML

- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15155
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.15155v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as promising surrogates for large 3D scientific simulations due to their ability to continuously model spatial and conditional fields, yet they face a critical fidelity-speed dilemma: deep MLPs suffer from high inference cost, while efficient embedding-based models lack sufficient expressiveness. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled Representation Refinement (DRR) architectural paradigm. D...

### 22. Panini: Continual Learning in Token Space via Structured Memory
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML

- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15156
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.15156v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Language models are increasingly used to reason over content they were not trained on, such as new documents, evolving knowledge, and user-specific data. A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the sa...
