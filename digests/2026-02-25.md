- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20197
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.20197v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a primary learning paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). However, during RL training, the enormous state space of MLLM and sparse rewards often leads to entropy collapse, policy degradation, or over-exploitation of suboptimal behaviors. This necessitates an exploration strategy that maintains productive stochasticity whi...

### 30. Golden Layers and Where to Find Them: Improved Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models Via Layer Gradient Analysis
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML

- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20207
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.20207v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Knowledge editing in Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to update the model's prediction for a specific query to a desired target while preserving its behavior on all other inputs. This process typically involves two stages: identifying the layer to edit and performing the parameter update. Intuitively, different queries may localize knowledge at different depths of the model, resulting in different sample-wise editing performance for a fixed edi...

### 31. Model Merging in the Essential Subspace

- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.20208v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate multiple task-specific fine-tuned models derived from a shared pre-trained checkpoint into a single multi-task model without additional training. Despite extensive research, task interference remains a major obstacle that often undermines the performance of merged models. In this paper, we propose ESM (Essential Subspace Merging) , a robust framework for effective model merging. We begin by performing Principal Co...

### 32. Multimodal Crystal Flow: Any-to-Any Modality Generation for Unified Crystal Modeling

- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.20210v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Crystal modeling spans a family of conditional and unconditional generation tasks across different modalities, including crystal structure prediction (CSP) and \emph{de novo} generation (DNG). While recent deep generative models have shown promising performance, they remain largely task-specific, lacking a unified framework that shares crystal representations across different generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Multimo...
