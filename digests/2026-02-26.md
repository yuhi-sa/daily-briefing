### 22. Neural network optimization strategies and the topography of the loss landscape
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML

- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.21276v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Neural networks are trained by optimizing multi-dimensional sets of fitting parameters on non-convex loss landscapes. Low-loss regions of the landscapes correspond to the parameter sets that perform well on the training data. A key issue in machine learning is the performance of trained neural networks on previously unseen test data. Here, we investigate neural network training by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) - a non-convex global optimizat...

- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21297
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.21297v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The standard way to evaluate language models on subjective tasks is through pairwise comparisons: an annotator chooses the "better" of two responses to a prompt. Leaderboards aggregate these comparisons into a single Bradley-Terry (BT) ranking, forcing heterogeneous preferences into a total order and violating basic social-choice desiderata. In contrast, social choice theory provides an alternative approach called maximal lotteries, which aggreg...
